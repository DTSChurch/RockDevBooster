# RockLauncher
Launch various Rock versions for testing purposes

Provides a GUI application that allows you to download any version of Rock from github,
compile it and store it as a template. These templates can be deployed any number of
times and launched to give you a "known good state" whenever you are testing code or
functionality.

The SQL database is stored in the App_Data folder so you don't have to worry about
reverting any database files either.

Requires Visual Studio, and SQL Local DB (should be installed with VS).
